PyView
======

This module tries to imitate freeview, which is a 
cpp package for visualisation of Freesurfer outputs.
PyView is designed to work inside IPython notebook only, 
makes use of advanced visualization and interactive widgets
inside IPython notebook. Therefore, using it outside IPython
notebook fails.
